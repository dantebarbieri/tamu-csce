# Computer Science and Computer Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University
This repository will accompany videos on the various subjects within. The idea is to help students build a more solid foundation for Computer Science. If students do not understand the basics, then advanced courses will be more challenging than necessary.

This repository contains:
1. [CSCE 121 - Introduction to Program Design and Concepts](CSCE%20121%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Program%20Design%20and%20Concepts)
2. [CSCE 221 - Data Structures and Algorithms](CSCE%20221%20-%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms)
