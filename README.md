# Computer Science and Computer Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University
This repository will accompany videos on the various subjects within. The idea is to help students build a more solid foundation for Computer Science. If students do not understand the basics, then advanced courses will be more challenging than necessary.

This repository contains:
